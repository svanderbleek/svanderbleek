### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* my research interests are computational logic, automated theorem proving, programming language theory, and computational thinking for algorithmic problem solving
* I'm focused on my career and making the transition from Senior Software Engineer to Staff Software Engineer
* I would eventually like to work in embedded/systems/distributed programming, machine learning/AI, or compilers but my background is in web development and I'm not ready to invest in projects currently
