## Hi ðŸ‘‹

This is my professional portfolio. If you'd like to chat, I'm always interested in talking about computer science and the tech industry or offering early and mid career mentorship. Reach out to me on X.

## Some Background

* Check out my pins, they are 4 of my favorite languages: Kotlin, Go, Haskell, and Python

* Have spoken at meetups and conferences, here's a short Papers We Love NYC talk on [unification](https://paperswelove.org/2018/video/sandy-vanderbleek-a-widespread-error-in-unification-algorithms/)
