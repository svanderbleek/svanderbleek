## Hi 👋

This is my professional portfolio. If you'd like to chat, I'm always interested in talking about computer science and the tech industry or offering early and mid career mentorship. Reach out to me on X.

## Some Background

* Check out my pins, they are small projects in some of my favorite languages: Go, Haskell, and Python
* My online teaching has 5 star reviews on [codementor](https://www.codementor.io/@svanderbleek)
* I have spoken at meetups and conferences, here's a short Papers We Love NYC talk on [unification](https://paperswelove.org/2018/video/sandy-vanderbleek-a-widespread-error-in-unification-algorithms/)
* I went to Oregon Programming Languages Summer School in [2017](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer17/participants.php)

## Recent Open Source Work

I have been learning Rust and contributing to projects that interest me, anything involving computational logic or formal methods.
